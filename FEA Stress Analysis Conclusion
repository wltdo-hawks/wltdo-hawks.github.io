Some points to take away from this analysis are the satisfied boundary conditions, the results of 
the normal stress and total deformation, and the overall information that was gathered based 
on the data from ANSYS. First, both the gravity and fixed support boundary 
conditions were satisfied. The weight due to the gravity was seen in the sagging of the door in 
the middle and the fixed supports had a 0 meter deformation, which were expected. That was 
the verification because sanity checks were done. Second, the results of the deformation 
showed that there would be a maximum deformation in the middle of about 2E-7 meters, 
which is very minimal and it will not dramatically affect the door in real life. The material will 
not break under these circumstances. As for the normal stress, there is compressive stress on 
the two ends of the tooth and tensile stress on the bottom edges. However, the stress is not 
great enough to cause deformation. With all this in mind, it is safe to say that the teeth on the 
rack gear of the door will not be deformed in any due to the weight of the door if oak wood is 
the material used.
